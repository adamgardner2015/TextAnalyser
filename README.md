# TextAnalyser
This tool takes an input file (which contains text) and builds a word cloud type list and saves to a CSV file.

It includes options to ignore capitalisation and / or punctuation.

eg. "This is my text. This text is cool".

Ignoring punctuation and capitalisation, the output for the above sentence would be:

| Word | Count |
| ---- | ----- |
| this | 2 |
| is | 2 |
| my | 1 |
| text | 2 |
| cool | 1 |
